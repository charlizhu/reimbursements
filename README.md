# This is for Club Mech's eTransfer reimbursements

I recently noticed that always filling out the AMS reimbursement form becomes quite dull and repetitive, and that it's not always necessary for the Treasurer to fill the body of the form out. 

This is an app (which is not complete yet) that will allow the Club Mech exec to interactively fill out the form. The results will be zipped appropriately, and the treasurer can review it and sign. There is a chance this might not be needed in the future after COVID, but this will be kept around just in case.
